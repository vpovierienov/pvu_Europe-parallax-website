        <h2>EU solidarity with Ukraine</h2>
        <p>
          The EU stands united in its solidarity with Ukraine and will continue to support Ukraine and its people
          together with its international partners, including through additional political, financial and humanitarian
          support.
          The EU has reacted swiftly and decisively to Russia’s aggression by adopting further restrictive measures in
          response, that will have massive and severe consequences for Russia

        <h2>EU actions to enhance global food security</h2>
        <p>
          The EU, as a long standing and reliable partner for countries around the world, is working to ensure global
          food security and build resilient food systems.
          Food availability is currently not at stake in the EU, since the continent is largely self-sufficient for many
          agricultural products. However, our agricultural sector is a net importer of specific products, for example
          feed protein. This vulnerability, together with high input costs, such as fertilisers and fossil energy, is
          causing production challenges for farmers and risks driving up food prices.
          The European Commission is proposing a range of short-term and medium-term actions to enhance global food
          security and to support farmers and consumers in the EU in light of rising food prices and input costs.

        <h2>The Global Gateway</h2>
        <p>
          The Global Gateway will deliver sustainable and high-quality projects, taking into account the needs of
          partner countries and ensuring lasting benefits for local communities. This will allow EU’s partners to
          develop their societies and economies, but also create opportunities for the EU Member States’ private sector
          to invest and remain competitive, whilst ensuring the highest environmental and labour standards, as well as
          sound financial management.
          The Global Gateway is the EU’s contribution to narrowing the global investment gap worldwide. It is in line
          with the commitment of the G7 leaders from June 2021 to launch a values-driven, high-standard and transparent
          infrastructure partnership to meet global infrastructure development needs. The Global Gateway is also fully
          aligned with the UN’s Agenda 2030 and its Sustainable Development Goals, as well as the Paris Agreement.

        <h2>Europe aims</h2>
        <p>
          In the coming weeks, a formal steering committee will be established to guide the continued development of the
          fellowship curriculum. Technical working groups will be established to further institutionalize a
          participatory approach, develop strategies to engage academic institutions across the region, and consider the
          long-term sustainability of this workforce programme.
